Repositories in [this organization](https://github.com/actions-rs) are [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which can be used to do the full CI circle for Rust projects.

## Recipes

### Quickstart âš¡

[Quickstart](./quickstart.md) recipe can be useful
if you are not familiar with GitHub Actions, never used CI thingies before
or just want to copy-n-paste some scripts into your project for an instant result.

### MSRV (Minimal Supported Rust Version) ðŸ”’

[MSRV](./msrv.md) recipe does almost the same what "[Quickstart](#quickstart)" do,
but also helps to guarantee the MSRV policy if you have any.

### Nightly clippy and rustfmt ðŸ“Ž

Ever had this problem when your CI build is broken,
because today's `nightly` is missing `clippy` or `rustfmt`?\
Yeah, I know, everyone hates that.

[Nightly lints](./nightly-lints.md) recipe solves this problem
by falling back to the most recent `nightly` build with the `clippy` available.
No more broken builds for you!
