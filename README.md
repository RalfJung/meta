Repositories in [this organization](https://github.com/actions-rs) are [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which can be used to do the full CI circle for Rust projects.

## Recipes

See the [@actions-rs/example](https://github.com/actions-rs/example) repository
with the live workflows described here.

### Quickstart ‚ö°

[Quickstart](./recipes/quickstart.md) recipe can be useful
if you are not familiar with GitHub Actions, never used CI thingies before
or just want to copy-n-paste some scripts into your project for an instant result.

### MSRV (Minimal Supported Rust Version) üîí

[MSRV](./recipes/msrv.md) recipe does almost the same what "[Quickstart](#quickstart)" do,
but also helps to guarantee the MSRV policy if you have any.

### Nightly clippy and rustfmt üìé

Ever had this problem when your CI build is broken,
because today's `nightly` is missing `clippy` or `rustfmt`?\
Yeah, I know, everyone hates that.

[Nightly lints](./recipes/nightly-lints.md) recipe is utilizing `rustup` ability
to find the most recent `nightly` toolchain with the components requested;
no more broken builds for you!

### Stable + beta + nightly + MSRV

[Matrix](./recipes/matrix.md) recipe combines three previous recipes together
in order to make an ultimate quickstart workflow.

### Perform security audit for your dependencies üõ°Ô∏è

[Security Audit](./recipes/security-audit.md) recipe is using [RustSec](https://rustsec.org/)
advisories database to audit crate for security vulnerabilities.
